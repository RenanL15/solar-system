      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found
        throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
        About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
        polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is
        land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is
        formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce
        mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core
        generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere,
        deflecting destructive solar winds.

      <h2>Sun</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
        perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
        reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light,
        ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. It is the most important source of
        energy for life on Earth.

      <h2>Moon</h2>
      <p>
        The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Together with Earth it forms
        the Earth-Moon satellite system. It is about one-quarter of Earth in
        diameter (comparable to the width of Australia). In the Solar System it
        is the fifth largest satellite, larger than any of the known dwarf
        planets and the largest (and most massive) satellite of a planet
        relative to the planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed
        a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the
        geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant
        atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about
        one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g). Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite
        in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

      <h2>Jupiter</h1>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
        System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
        that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly
        less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third
        brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and
        Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named
        after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.

      <h2>Mars</h1>
      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in
        the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English
        language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial
        planet with a thin atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed of
        elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and
        nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys,
        dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped
        moons: Phobos and Deimos.

      </a>
      <h2>Venus</h1>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman
        goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
        night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to
        the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that of
        Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a
        day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few hours
        following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, it has been
        seen in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth
        days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal
        rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to
        rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and
        does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the
        Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. Venus does not
        have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the
        planets in the Solar System.

      <h2>Saturn</h1>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
        Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of
        about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only
        one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
        volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
        the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
        of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
        (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between
        gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes. Like Venus,
        Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and
        its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds
        28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near
        the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise,
        usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like
        object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the
        planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to
        Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of
        approximately 116 days.

      <h2>Neptune</h1>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar
        planet. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
        diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
        It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its
        near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus
        because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
        atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant
        planets (the other one being Uranus).

      </a>
      <h2>Uranus</h1>
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
        the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was
        the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and
        father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and
        fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in
        composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which
        differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this
        reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to
        distinguish them from the other giant planets.
